ElectionGuard is an **open source** software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. Announced on at the [Build developer conference](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=63211), ElectionGuard enables end-to-end verification of elections as well as support the publication of results from ballot comparison audits. The ElectionGuard SDK leverages [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) to ensure that votes recorded by electronic systems of any type remain encrypted, secure, and secret. Results can be published online or made available to third-party organizations for secure validation, and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted.
