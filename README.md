ElectionGuard is an open source software development kit (SDK) that will make voting more secure, accessible. Announced on May 6 at the Build developer conference, ElectionGuard will enable end-to-end verification of elections, open results to third-party organizations for secure validation, and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted.

It will be available starting this summer to election officials and election technology suppliers who can incorporate the technology into voting systems. We encourage the election technology community to work with us and begin building offerings based on this technology and expect early prototypes using ElectionGuard will be ready for piloting during the 2020 elections in the United States, with significant deployments for subsequent election cycles. Over time we will seek to update and improve the SDK to support additional voting scenarios such as mail-in ballots and ranked choice voting. 

Microsoft will not charge for using ElectionGuard and will not profit from partnering with election technology suppliers that incorporate it into their products. When launched, the source code for ElectionGuard will be made available in this github repo.
