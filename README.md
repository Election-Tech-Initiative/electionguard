[![Microsoft Defending Democracy Program: ElectionGuard][1]](http://microsoft.github.io/electionguard/)

[![license][2]](LICENSE)

ElectionGuard is an **open source** software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. Announced at the [Build developer conference][3], ElectionGuard enables end-to-end verification of elections as well as support the publication of results from ballot comparison audits. The ElectionGuard SDK leverages [homomorphic encryption][4] to ensure that votes recorded by electronic systems of any type remain encrypted, secure, and secret. Results can be published online or made available to third-party organizations for secure validation, and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted.
