### Creating a Pull Request

All pull requests should have an accompanying issue. Create one if there is not one matching your code. The code will be checked by continuous integration. Once this CI passes, the code will be reviewed, ideally approved, then merged.

### CLA

Open source contributions require you to agree to a standard Microsoft Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit [this page][microsoft-open-source-cla].

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
