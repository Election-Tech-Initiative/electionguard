## Getting Started

### C-Implementation Submodule
For each platform, the C-Implementation in the submodule must be built first.
The instructions vary per platform.

1. Initialize the submodule
2. Navigate to `libs\ElectionGuard-SDK-C-Implementation`
3. Follow platform specific instructions

#### Linux

1. Install cmake and gmp (`sudo apt-get install cmake libgmp3-dev`)
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `libelectionguard.so` should be created

#### MacOS (.dylib)

1. Install cmake and gmp (`brew install cmake gmp`)
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `libelectionguard.dylib` is created

#### Windows (.dll)

1. Install cmake and gmp ([Use Step 1 from Windows Instructions for C-Implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/ElectionGuard-SDK-C-Implementation/blob/master/README-windows.md))
2. `cmake -S . -B build -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `electionguard.dll` is created

### C# Library Solution
_Note: This build will copy the library created by the submodule build._

Use Visual Studio or `dotnet build` to build.


### Testing

_Warning: Prior to testing, the submodule and the solution must be built in correct order._

Use `dotnet test` to start unit tests or Visual Studio Test Explorer.
