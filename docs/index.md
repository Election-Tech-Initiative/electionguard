## Welcome to the ElectionGuard SDK

ElectionGuard is an **open source** software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. It is designed for election system vendors to incorporate [end-to-end verifiability](Glossary/#end-to-end-verifiable-elections) into their systems and any interested organization to perform and publish [post-election audits](Glossary/#post-election-audit) using ElectionGuard as a secure publishing platform.

    Welcome! Thanks for your interest. Trying to figure out how to help and learn? If you're a developer, head over to the [**developer getting started**](develop/Getting_Started.md). If you're an election administrator or want to learn more about ElectionGuard and its underpinnings, start with [**the guide**](getting_started/index.md). If you want to help and aren't a developer, all kinds of help with documentation, outreach, and advocacy is welcomed. Follow [**discussions**](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard/discussions), join the [**office hours**](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard/discussions/61), and check out the [**roadmap**](overview/Roadmap.md) to see where it's intended to go.


## Open-Source

## Security Issues Reporting

We encourage the developer and security community to conduct research, report issues, and suggest improvements on this code base. However, unlike performance or feature bugs, please do **not** report security vulnerabilities in public Github comments. Each repository has a SECURITY file with instructions on responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities under Microsoft's CVD process.
