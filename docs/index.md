![Microsoft Defending Democracy Program: ElectionGuard](images/electionguard-banner.svg)

ElectionGuard is an **open source** software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. It enables [end-to-end verifiable elections](guide/Glossary.md#end-to-end-verifiable-elections) and [post-election audits](guide/Glossary.md#post-election-audit). 

!!! info "New to ElectionGuard?"
    Start with [How ElectionGuard Works](). If you're a developer, start with our [Developer Guide](guide/Overview.md).

## Open-Source
This library and all linked ElectionGuard projects, are licensed under the MIT license. There is no fee for using ElectionGuard.

## Security Issues Reporting

We encourage the developer and security community to conduct research, report issues, and suggest improvements on this code base. However, unlike performance or feature bugs, please do **not** report security vulnerabilities in public Github comments. Each repository has a SECURITY file with instructions on responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities under Microsoft's CVD process.
