![Election Tech Initiative: ElectionGuard][election-guard-banner]

## What is ElectionGuard?

ElectionGuard is an **open source** software development kit (SDK) that improves confidence and participation in elections. It is designed for election system vendors to incorporate [end-to-end verifiability][glossary-end-to-end-verifiable] into their systems and any interested organization to perform and publish [post-election audits][glossary-post-election-audit].

!!! info "New to ElectionGuard?"
    Welcome! Thanks for your interest. Trying to figure out how to help and learn? If you're a developer, head over to the [**developer getting started**][develop-getting-started]. If you want to help and aren't a developer, all kinds of help with documentation, outreach, and advocacy is welcomed. Follow [**discussions**][election-guard-discussions], join the [**office hours**][weekly-office-hours], and check out the [**roadmap**][roadmap] to see where it's intended to go.

## Open-Source

This library and all linked ElectionGuard projects, are licensed under the MIT license. There is no fee for using ElectionGuard.

## Security Issues Reporting

We encourage the developer and security community to conduct research, report issues, and suggest improvements on this code base. However, unlike performance or feature bugs, please do **not** report security vulnerabilities in public Github comments. Each repository has a SECURITY file with instructions on responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities under Microsoft's CVD process.
