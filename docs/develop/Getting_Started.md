# Getting Started

ElectionGuard as an SDK provides a specification and reference implementations with specific data format. If you're looking to develop code with ElectionGuard, you might be wondering where to start. There are two paths:

1. [**Create an app**][applications] using ElectionGuard
2. [**Contribute**][contribute] to ElectionGuard's open source

!!! tip
    If you're having trouble understanding where to start, take a look at **[versioning]** to get a good idea of what is still in progress.

## Create an App

There are many different possible applications that can be created using ElectionGuard reference implementations or for ElectionGuard. A helpful starting list can be found within **[applications][applications]**. Feel free to use [badges][badges] to indicate which version of the specification the app was developed for. 

## Contribute to Open Source

ElectionGuard is an open source platform and depends on an active community and ecosystem. The **[contribute][contribute]** page highlights some top level ways to contribute. For those that want to jump right in, take a look at our **[repositories][repositories]**.

!!! note
    Each repository houses the **in-depth developer documentation** for coding with the repositories.
