### Release Notes

#### v1.0

_Updates from previous version_

- The large prime p and corresponding cofactor r were changed to correctly match the result of the process for the derivation of the prime.
- The equations for generating proofs of ballot correctness have been optimized.
- Auxiliary keys have been eliminated in favor of using the existing keys for both ordinary and exponential ElGamal encryption.
- A more flexible structure of ballot chaining has been introduced to allow for non-linear chaining or no chaining at all.
- Smaller parameters suitable for testing are included.
- The election record of this version should match that of the prior v0.95 and therefore require no verifier changes (with the exception of using the corrected prime).

#### v0.95

_Updates from previous version_

- The large prime p and corresponding cofactor r were changed to move the prime p further from 2^4096.
- A section specifically about writing verifiers was added.
