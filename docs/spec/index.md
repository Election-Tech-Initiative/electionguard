# ElectionGuard Official Specifications 

The official versions of the ElectionGuard Specifications are listed below and stand as the primary source of reference when discussing the [ElectionGuard Specification]. Each version includes a [badge] that can be used to quickly display which versions are supported or used by products following the specification. To follow along with the code versioning, see the [versioning].

### Release Notes

#### v2.1
 
Version 2.1 of the ElectionGuard Design Specification has been significantly extended compared to version 2.0.0 and contains several significant changes.
 
- Key generation: Three sets of keys are now generated by the guardians in order to support distinct uses; and a guardian record has been created, which the guardians must verify at the end of the key generation process.
- Ballot preparation: a selection encryption identifier is now created for each ballot, which is used to link together all the ciphertexts and proofs associated to a single ballot; signed ElGamal is now used for encrypting all data other than voter selections; the ballot nonce must now be encrypted and included in each ballot.
- Confirmation codes: A voting device information hash has been added; the simple ballot chaining mode has been detailed and refined.
- Tallying operations: Guardians now verify the election record before starting the tallying operations; support for weighting ballots during aggregation has been added; the verifiable decryption process and protocols have been detailed and updated.
- Audit of challenged ballots: The opening of challenged ballots has been made more efficient by releasing relevant encryption nonces instead of performing verifiable decryption.
- Hash computation steps have been revised and updated in many places, and a hash function that maps to integers modulo q has been defined separately.
- Several components have been designated as optional such as supplemental verifiable fields, contest data, and pre-encrypted ballots.
- A concrete list of verification steps for pre-encrypted ballots has been added.

#### v2.0

2.0 is a major refactor of the ElectionGuard specification. It includes the following capabilities

- The size of the proofs in the election record has been reduced by more than 90% â€“ reducing the size of the full election record by about a factor of 3.
- Computing the proofs takes about 20% less time.
- Placeholder selections have been eliminated entirely.
- Guardians are no longer part of the election record as their partial decryptions and proofs have been administratively combined into single full decryptions and proofs.
- Range proofs are now included to support voting systems like cumulative voting, range voting, STAR-voting, Borda count, and others.
- A new pre-encrypted ballot format is included to support vote-by-mail, central count, and paper-only poll sites.
- Support is now available for instant verification allowing voters to confirm the accuracy of challenge ballots without waiting for the election record to be published.
- New default parameters are used with ln(2) replacing the Euler-Mascheroni constant as the basis for generation of the large prime.
- The data format of hashes has been clearly described to eliminate ambiguities.

#### v1.0

_Updates from previous version_

- The large prime p and corresponding cofactor r were changed to correctly match the result of the process for the derivation of the prime.
- The equations for generating proofs of ballot correctness have been optimized.
- Auxiliary keys have been eliminated in favor of using the existing keys for both ordinary and exponential ElGamal encryption.
- A more flexible structure of ballot chaining has been introduced to allow for non-linear chaining or no chaining at all.
- Smaller parameters suitable for testing are included.
- The election record of this version should match that of the prior v0.95 and therefore require no verifier changes (with the exception of using the corrected prime).

#### v0.95

_Updates from previous version_

- The large prime p and corresponding cofactor r were changed to move the prime p further from 2^4096.
- A section specifically about writing verifiers was added.
- Various small clarifications and corrections were included.

#### v0.85

- Initial public release of specification for ElectionGuard
