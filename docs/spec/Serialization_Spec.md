# ElectionGuard Serialization Specification

This specification exists to help anyone trying to write a compatible implementation or, crucially, anyone trying to write a verifier. The design says what has to be done, how, and why. The data serialization spec describes the data formats used in the implementation to achieve the design. The data serialization spec currently matches the v2.0 implementation.
