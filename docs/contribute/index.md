2. Post questions or ideas in our [**discussion board**][election-guard-discussions]
3. Join our [**weekly video office hours**][election-guard-weekly-office-hours]

5. Add to and improve documentation. Keep it Plain English and include [helpful images][undraw-illustrations].

## Contributions

ElectionGuard relies on its community for its success. For example, for end-to-end verifiable elections, integrity is improved by the number of independent verifiers that confirm the results of an election.
