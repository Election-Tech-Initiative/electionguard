# ElectionGuard Glossary

## Overview

Using ElectionGuard, end-to-end verifiability, and elections themselves use a variety of terms in the conductance of an election, as well as the encryption, tally, and publishing thereof. Many of these terms have variants used in different locales. Given the potential ambiguity of terminology, we present this Glossary. It states the precise meaning and usage of the terms used by the ElectionGuard SDK and related specifications and tools.

Whenever possible, we used terms and meanings consistent the [NIST Elections Guide](https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionEventLogging/index.html).

## Terms

### accepted ballot 
A ballot that is accepted for inclusion in election results and is either: cast or spoiled.

### auxiliary key pair
Pair of keys (public & secret) used to encrypt/decrypt information sent between guardians

### available guardian
A guardian that has announced as present for the decryption phase

### ballot box
A collection of ballots that have been either cast or spoiled.

### ballot chain
### base hash $Q$
Represented as $Q$

### cast ballot
A ballot which a voter has accepted as valid to be included in the official election tally.

### ciphertext ballot
An encrypted representation of a voter's filled-in ballot.

### ciphertext election context
The cryptographic context of an election that is configured during the Key Ceremony

### compensated decryption share
A partial decryption share value computed by an available guardian to compensate for a missing guardian so that the missing guardian's share can be generated and the election results can be successfully decrypted.

### contest
A *contest* in an [*election*](#election) consists of a set of options together with a selection limit that indicates the number of selections that are allowed to be made in that contest. In most elections, most contests have a selection limit of one. However, a larger selection limit (e.g., select up to three) is not uncommon in some elections. Approval voting can be achieved by setting the selection limit to the total number of options in a contest. Ranked choice voting is not supported in this version of ElectionGuard, but it may be enabled in a future version.2 Also, write-ins are assumed to be explicitly registered or allowed to be lumped into a single "write-ins" category for the purpose of verifiable tallying. Verifiable tallying of free-form write-ins may be best done with a MixNet3 design.

A legitimate vote in a contest consists of a set of selections with cardinality not exceeding the selection limit of that contest. To accommodate legitimate undervotes, the internal representation of a contest is augmented with “placeholder” options equal in number to the selection limit. Placeholder options are selected as necessary to force the total number of selections made in a contest to be equal to the selection limit. When the selection limit is one, for example, the single placeholder option can be thought of as a “none of the above” option.

With larger selection limits, the number of placeholder options selected corresponds to the number of additional options that a voter could have selected in a contest.

### description hash (more properly [base hash](#base-hash-q))
A hash representation of the original [election description](#election-description----see-election-manifest)

### decryption mediator
A component or actor responsible for composing each guardian's partial decryptions or compensated decryptions into the plaintext tally

### decryption share
A guardian's partial share of a decryption

### election

### election description -- see [election manifest](#election-manifest)
The election metadata that describes the structure and type of the election, including geopolitical units, contests, candidates, ballot styles, etc. A subset of this data, the [internal election description](#internal-election-description) is encrypted with the [joint public key](#joint-key) generated by the [key ceremony](#key-ceremony) conducted by the [election guardians](#guardian) to generate the [extended base hash](#extended-base-hash-overlineq) that will be used to uniquely associate an encrypted ballot with a specific election.

### encryption device
The device that is doing the encryption

### end-to-end-verifiable election
End-to-end verifiability is a set of security, cryptographic, and voting user experiences that provide voters  the ability to confirm their vote was included in the published election tally, and independent observers and third parties the ability to confirm the tally was correctly computed and not tampered with

### election guardian

### election key pair
Pair of keys (public & secret) used to encrypt/decrypt election

### election manifest
An election manifest (see [election manifest](concepts/Election_Manifest.md) article) contains election metadata in json format that is parsed into an [Election Description](#election-description----see-election-manifest)

### election partial key backup
A point on a secret polynomial and commitments to verify this point for a designated guardian.

### election polynomial
The election polynomial is the mathematical expression that each Guardian defines to solve for his or her private key. A different point associated with the polynomial is shared with each of the other guardians so that the guardians can come together to derive the polynomial function and solve for the private key.

### extended base hash $\overline{Q}$

### encrypting a ballot
As [outlined directly in the ElectionGuard Specification](../spec/0.95.0/5_Ballot_encryption.md)

### encrypted tally
The homomorphically-combined and encrypted representation of all selections made for each option on every contest in the election.

### guardian (see [election guardian](#election-guardian))
One of a number of independent, trustworthy individuals who participate in [key ceremonies](#key-ceremony) to create a [joint public election key](#joint-key) as well as [tally ceremonies](#tally)

### internal election description
The subset of the [election description](#election-description----see-election-manifest) required by ElectionGuard and combined with the [joint public key](#joint-key) to create the [extended base hash](#extended-base-hash-overlineq) used at the instantiation of the [encrypted ballot](#encrypting-a-ballot) [ballot chain](#ballot-chain) ballots are correctly associated with an election.  This component mutates the state of the Election Description.

### joint key 
Combined public key from election public keys of each guardian

### key ceremony 
The process conducted at the beginning of the election to create the joint encryption context for encrypting ballots during the election.

### key ceremony mediator
A mediator to mediate communication (if needed) of information such as keys between the guardians

### master nonce
A mediator to mediate communication (if needed) of information such as keys between the guardians

### missing guardian
A guardian who was configured during the Key Ceremony but who is not present for the decryption of the election results.

### nonce
A random number used to derive encryptions

### plaintext ballot 
The plaintext representation of a voter's selections

### post-election audit 
A post-election audit is

### $Q$ --see [Base hash](#base-hash-q)


### $\overline{Q}$ --see [Extended base hash](#extended-base-hash-barq)


### quorum
The minimum count (_threshold_) of guardians that must be present in order to successfully decrypt the election results.

### sealed ballot

### spoiled ballot
A ballot which a voter did not accept as valid and is not included in the tally.

### tally ceremony

### verification code
A unique hash value generated by an Encryption Device to anonymously identify a ballot

### undervote
An ***undervote*** in a **[contest](#contest)** or **[election](#election)**

### unknown ballot
An *unknown ballot* is a [sealed ballot](#sealed-ballot) which has not been determined to be [cast](#cast-ballot) or [spoiled](#spoiled-ballot), or that may have been spoiled but is otherwise not published in the election results.
