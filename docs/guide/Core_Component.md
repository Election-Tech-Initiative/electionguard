There are various implementations of the core component of the ElectionGuard SDK. This piece performs election functions such as vote encryption, decryption, key generation, and tallying. This code is meant to be run on voting system hardware and to be integrated into existing (or new) voting system software. The ElectionGuard SDK is meant to add end-to-end verifiability and encryption into 3rd party comprehensive voting systems. There are provided simplistic, proof-of-concept applications to understand how each implementation of the API should be called. Currently, there are two available implementations.
