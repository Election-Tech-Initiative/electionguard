# Getting Started

There are many places to start start in ElectionGuard. If you're looking to develop see below, if you just want to research see the rest of the guide. 

## SDK

The [ElectionGuard software development kit (SDK)](Core_Component.md) contains two major parts. The core component for developing with ElectionGuard and reference implementations that interact with core component or provide a peek into the pieces required for the election process. 

### Latest

These are the latest projects from ElectionGuard. If you're looking to contribute, these are the best places to start.

[`electionguard-python`](Core_Component.md#python)

[`electionguard-web-api`](Implementations.md)

## Specifications
These [documents](../spec/Overview.md) contains the fundamental specifications, documentation, architecture, and mathematical/cryptographic proofs that underpin ElectionGuard. If you're looking to understand the system better, or want to know how to integrate the various components, there is a lot of valuable information contained here.
