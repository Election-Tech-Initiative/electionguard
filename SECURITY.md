## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft][microsoft-github], [Azure][azure-github], [DotNet][dotnet-github], [AspNet][aspnet-github], [Xamarin][xamarin-github], and [many more][microsoft-open-source].

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets Microsoft's [definition][microsoft-security-bug] of a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center at [secure@microsoft.com](secure-microsoft-email).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page][microsoft-pgp-key].

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc][msrc].

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
